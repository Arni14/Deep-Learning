# Arnav's Deep Learning Space
This repo is basically a personal space for me to explore Deep Learning practictioning. I've worked heavily on theory in the last year and while that's awesome, I'm trying to hone in on really squeezing the juice out of the frameworks and learning to builds some cool things. As such, there are currently six main components to this repo at the moment. 

1. Convolution (straight out of chapter 6 of d2l, but lots of adjustments for me to learn and play around with these tools).
2. MLPs (Also from d2l but with some altered implementations and a bit more complexity).
3. Computation (A mix of chapter 5 and 12, mainly focused on toying with compute to see how we can really use that for efficiency and scalability). 
4. Modern Architectures (Starting at AlexNet, moving on to VGG, then Networks in Networks, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and DenseNet). 
5. Recurrent Neural Networks: Learning about modelling for sequential data with the basic idea of hidden units storing latent information about states preceding it. In addition, implemented this RNN from scratch along with seeing how to use the PyTorch RNN API to do so. 
6. Modern RNNs: LSTMs, GRUs, Seq-to-Seq Learning, Deep RNNs, and Encoder-Decoder architectures. Lot's of funs stuff here pulled from chapter 9 of d2l, but some of my own implementations. 
Hope you all enjoy taking a look!
